# I2Proxy
## A web browser extension for accessing I2P network anonymously
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description:

I2P, which stands for "Invisible Internet Project," is an anonymous network layer that allows for secure and private communication over the internet. It is designed to provide strong anonymity and privacy protections for its users. Unlike traditional internet connections, which expose your IP address and can be tracked, I2P routes traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of roughly 55,000 computers, known as routers. This ensures that your online activities are obscured and more difficult to trace.
I2Proxy is a web browser extension that is configured to proxy all traffic through the I2P network. By using I2Proxy, users can access websites and services hosted within the I2P network, known as "eepsites," with a high level of anonymity.
